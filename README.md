# Lucene Search Engine

## Building, Compiling, Creating the Index, Querying the Index and Using Trec-eval to compare scores.
```
git clone https://github.com/Donegaan/Lucene_Search_Engine.git
cd Lucene_Search_Engine/
./run.sh
```
In the run script you can change the score model flag `-score` between `bm25` or `vector`.

## Results
`standard-results.txt` is the results when using the StandardAnalyzer class. This is the results I compare my custom analyzer against.
